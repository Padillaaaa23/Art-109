          <h3>Nuestro Futuro</h3>
          <p>"Nuestro Futuro" is a collaborative project between artist Samantha Padilla and pastry chef Laura Zoro, both Colombian, created to raise awareness about the challenges faced by Indigenous groups in Colombia today. This personal project features a cake sculpture resembling a jewelry stand, symbolizing the handmade jewelry that Indigenous people are often compelled to sell to survive in Colombian cities after being displaced and seeing their lands exploited.
